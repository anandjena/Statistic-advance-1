        "1.What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "- A random variable in probability theory is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random phenomenon. In Python, this concept is typically implemented using libraries such as scipy.stats, which provide objects representing both discrete and continuous probability distributions. For example, the binom function from scipy.stats can define a discrete random variable that follows a binomial distribution, while the norm function can represent a continuous random variable with a normal distribution. These objects allow you to perform various probabilistic computations such as calculating probabilities (using methods like pmf for discrete variables or pdf for continuous ones), cumulative probabilities (cdf), and generating random samples (rvs). By using these tools, you can simulate random processes, analyze statistical behavior, and make probabilistic predictions in a structured and mathematically sound way.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "- Random variables are generally classified into two main types: discrete and continuous.\n",
        "\n",
        "A discrete random variable takes on a countable number of distinct values. These values usually result from counting something, such as the number of heads in a series of coin tosses, the number of customers arriving at a store in an hour, or the number of defective items in a batch. Examples of distributions that describe discrete random variables include the binomial, Poisson, and geometric distributions. The probabilities associated with each possible value are represented using a probability mass function (PMF).\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a continuous random variable can take on any value within a given range or interval, often representing measurements such as height, weight, time, or temperature. Since the number of possible values is infinite and uncountable, the probability of the variable taking on an exact value is zero; instead, probabilities are defined over intervals using a probability density function (PDF). Examples of distributions used for continuous random variables include the normal, exponential, and uniform distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are also more advanced types and classifications, such as mixed random variables, which have both discrete and continuous components, but these are less common in basic probability theory. The key distinction remains whether the variable takes on countable values (discrete) or values from a continuum (continuous).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "- The main difference between discrete and continuous distributions lies in the type of values their random variables can take and how probabilities are assigned to those values.\n",
        "\n",
        "A discrete distribution describes the probability of outcomes for a discrete random variable, which takes on a countable set of distinct values. Examples include the number of heads in coin tosses or the number of customers arriving at a store. In discrete distributions, probabilities are assigned directly to specific values using a probability mass function (PMF). For instance, in a binomial distribution, you can calculate the exact probability of getting, say, 3 successes in 5 trials.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a continuous distribution describes the probability of outcomes for a continuous random variable, which can take on an infinite number of values within a given range or interval. These variables represent measurements, like height, weight, or time. In this case, probabilities are not assigned to individual values (since the probability of any single point is zero) but rather to intervals using a probability density function (PDF). For example, with a normal distribution, you can calculate the probability that a variable falls between 1.0 and 2.0, but not the exact probability of it being exactly 1.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, discrete distributions deal with countable outcomes and assign probabilities to exact values, while continuous distributions handle uncountably infinite outcomes and assign probabilities to ranges of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "- A probability distribution function (PDF) refers to a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a range of values. The term PDF is most commonly associated with continuous random variables, where it specifically means the probability density function. For continuous variables, the PDF gives the relative likelihood of the variable falling within a particular interval, rather than assigning probabilities to exact values (since the probability of any single point is zero). Instead, to find the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a certain range, one must integrate the PDF over that interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a normal distribution, the bell-shaped curve is the PDF. The total area under this curve equals 1, representing the entire probability space. If you want to know the probability that a normally distributed variable falls between 1 and 2, you would integrate the PDF from 1 to 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that for discrete random variables, the analogous concept is the probability mass function (PMF) rather than a PDF. The PMF gives the actual probability of each possible discrete outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, a PDF in probability theory is a function that describes how probabilities are distributed over a continuous random variable’s possible values, allowing us to compute the likelihood of that variable falling within a certain range.\n",

        "5.How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "- The cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the probability distribution function (PDF) serve different but complementary roles in describing the behavior of a random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The PDF, or probability density function, is used with continuous random variables and describes the relative likelihood of the variable taking a value within an infinitesimally small interval. It does not give actual probabilities at specific points because the probability of a continuous random variable being exactly any one value is zero. Instead, to find the probability that the variable lies within a certain interval (e.g., between 2 and 5), you integrate the PDF over that range. For discrete random variables, the equivalent of a PDF is the probability mass function (PMF), which directly gives the probability of specific values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CDF, or cumulative distribution function, applies to both discrete and continuous random variables and gives the cumulative probability that the variable will take a value less than or equal to a given number. In other words, it tells you the total probability accumulated up to a certain point. Mathematically, for a continuous variable, the CDF at a point x is the integral of the PDF from negative infinity to x. For a discrete variable, it is the sum of the PMF values up to x.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while the PDF (or PMF) describes the local behavior of a random variable (likelihood at a specific point or interval), the CDF describes the global behavior by accumulating probabilities up to a point. The CDF is always non-decreasing and ranges from 0 to 1, offering a complete picture of the distribution's cumulative behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "- A discrete uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which a finite number of outcomes are equally likely to occur. In other words, each possible value of the random variable has the same probability. This distribution is \"uniform\" because the probabilities are uniformly distributed across all outcomes, and it is \"discrete\" because the set of possible outcomes is countable.\n",
        "\n",
        "A classic example of a discrete uniform distribution is the roll of a fair die. If you roll a standard six-sided die, the outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} each have a probability of 1/6. The probability mass function (PMF) for a discrete uniform distribution is defined as:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This distribution is useful when modeling situations where there is no inherent bias toward any particular outcome, and all results within a specified range are equally probable. Examples include drawing a card at random from a set of numbered cards, or selecting a winner from a list where everyone has an equal chance.\n",

        "- The **Bernoulli distribution** is one of the simplest and most fundamental probability distributions in statistics. It models the outcome of a single experiment (or trial) that has only two possible results: success (usually coded as 1) and failure (coded as 0). The key properties of a Bernoulli distribution are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "    (1). **Two outcomes**: The random variable can only take the values 0 and 1. These are typically interpreted as \"failure\" and \"success,\" respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "    (2). **Single parameter $p$**: The distribution is defined by a single parameter $p$, which represents the probability of success (i.e., the probability that the variable takes the value 1). The probability of failure is therefore $1 - p$.\n",

        "\n",
        "    (5). **Variance**: The variance is given by $\\text{Var}(X) = p(1 - p)$, which measures the spread or variability of the outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    (6). **Memoryless for a single trial**: While not truly memoryless like the geometric or exponential distributions, the Bernoulli distribution models a single independent trial, and thus each trial does not depend on past outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    (7). **Foundation for other distributions**: The Bernoulli distribution serves as the building block for more complex distributions like the **binomial distribution**, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",

For example, the **sample mean ($\\bar{x}$)** is a point estimate of the population mean ($\\mu$), and the **sample proportion ($\\hat{p}$)** is a point estimate of the population proportion ($p$). Point estimates are easy to calculate and interpret but provide no information about the **uncertainty** or **variability** of the estimate.\n",

        "In contrast, an **interval estimate** provides a **range of values**, typically in the form of a **confidence interval**, that is likely to contain the true population parameter.

The **width** of the interval depends on the sample size, variability in the data, and the desired confidence level.\n",

For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and construct intervals in the same way, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.
